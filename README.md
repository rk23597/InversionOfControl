# InversionOfControl

IoC is a designed pattern , which is based on implementing the Dependency injection principle . That means IoC allows acheiving loosly coupling betn diffent objects. IoC we can apply using interface or abstraction class and it allows us to reach inversion of contro  ( One object control behaviour of other object but they don't have strong dependencies).


So what is the practicle meaning of using this pattern ? if we want to make independent one class form another class then you have to apply abstraction (use interface) which mediates the interaction  between classes.
